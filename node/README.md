Node.js Code
============

Introduction
--------

This module contains any node.js server code that we may use. This typically interfaces with the Java server via stdin/stdout.

This includes code for:

- parsing iframes
- rendering HTML

Set up
--------

In order to set up this code to run it on your machine:

- install node.js
- cd to this folder
- run `npm install` (installs libraries that you don't want in this repo)
- run `node [.js file name to run]`
