Node.js Code
============

Introduction
--------

This module contains any node.js server code that we may use. This typically interfaces with the Java server via stdin/stdout or via its RESTful HTTP API.

This includes code for parsing iframes.

Set up
--------

In order to set up this code to run it on your machine:

- install node.js
- cd to this folder
- run `npm install` (installs libraries that you don't want in this repo)
- run `node [.js file name to run]`

Test
-------

In order to run the unit tests developed for the node.js system run `npm test`.
