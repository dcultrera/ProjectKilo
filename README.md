Culture Glasses
---------------

*Client: Lance Robson, Metaswitch Networks*

Google Glass is an amazing product, but can make the wearer seem a
little geeky. The goal of this project is to compensate for that, by using
the Google Glass camera to identify a barcode on a non-geeky cultural
product you are given in a social situation (say a book or vinyl LP), and
then provide a private display with cues of clever things to say about it.
This will probably come from online reviews, but your software will
need to spot the barcode, find the reviews, and distil them into a few
words that make the wearer seem as smart as possible.
